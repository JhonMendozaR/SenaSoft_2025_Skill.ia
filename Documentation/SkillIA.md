# Unlocking Potential: Skill.IA

ðŸ‘¥ **Group 8: TitÃ­ Devs**

Project developed for SenaSoft 2025

**Skill.ia** is an intelligent platform designed to help professionals discover their true potential. It accurately assesses the user's technical skills, soft skills, and English proficiency through brief and personalized evaluations, generating a clear diagnosis of their current situation. Based on these results, it creates an adaptive professional development roadmap that organizes goals and learning in logical order according to each person's profile and aspirations. As the user progresses, an intelligent conversational agent accompanies them, offering guidance, recommendations, and emotional support that evolve alongside their progress. All information is managed in a structured database that stores their profile, results, achieved milestones, and level of advancement, allowing the system to learn from their journey and always provide relevant and personalized guidance toward their professional growth.

## Use Case Scenario

### User

Daniela is a data analyst with three years of experience. She masters Excel and basic SQL, but feels she's falling behind when she hears her colleagues talk about machine learning and advanced visualization.

### Problem

Her English is functional but limited. She wants to grow professionally, but is overwhelmed by the number of options: Python first or perfect SQL? Invest in English or technical skills? Should she focus on leadership or deepen technical knowledge?

### Expected Solution

Daniela needs a system that honestly assesses where she stands today, shows her a clear and logical development path, and accompanies her with intelligent guidance at each phase. When she's starting out, she needs a tutor to explain basic concepts. As she progresses, she needs a mentor to challenge her and help her make strategic career decisions.

### Final Result

The current state is uncertainty and dispersed effort. The desired state is absolute clarity about her current position, a structured path forward, and an intelligent companion that evolves with her.

- Progress history and completed modules in the roadmap
- Previous interactions with the conversational agent
- Basic professional profile (experience, sector, aspirations)

### Technical Resources
- Advanced language model APIs for conversational processing
- Competency evaluation and categorization systems
- Adaptive learning roadmap generation frameworks
- Conversational context analysis tools

### Restrictions
- Initial diagnosis must be simple enough to complete in minutes, but deep enough to generate meaningful roadmaps
- Interaction with the agent must feel natural and not robotic
- The system must work with limited user information at the start

---

## Expected Results

Based on the idea, 3 transformative solutions are expected:

### Transparent Diagnosis

A clear and actionable profile that shows the user where they really stand in their technical, soft, and English communication skills. Not vague evaluations, but precise categorizations that the user can understand and validate.

### Living Roadmap

A personalized development path that is not a generic list of courses, but a logical and progressive sequence of milestones specific to the user's profile. The path must make sense for someone in their particular situation, not for "all professionals".

### Evolutionary Accompaniment

A conversational agent that genuinely changes its way of interacting according to the user's progress. When the user is starting out, it should explain, simplify, and guide with patience. When the user advances, it should challenge, question, and guide strategically. The agent must demonstrate that it understands the user's exact context in their journey.

---

## Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

The system evaluates, guides, and accompanies the user in their professional development through three fundamental components:

- **Transparent Diagnosis:** Initial and continuous skills evaluation
- **Living Roadmap:** Personalized learning path that is dynamically generated
- **Evolutionary Accompaniment:** Intelligent conversational agent that adapts its behavior according to user progress

The MVP must receive user data, process it, generate understandable results, and maintain a progress history that evolves over time with the user, allowing constant transformation of their knowledge (Technical skills, Soft skills) and exponential growth of their potential.

This methodology allows adjusting system functionalities flexibly, prioritizing constant feedback and continuous improvement throughout the development process.

---

## Autonomy and Integrated Interaction - AI

### General Philosophy

Our system starts from a centralized idea: a single type of user who converses with an assistant that provides information, advice, and help, and generates roadmaps thanks to the capacity an intelligent agent has to create them.

There are no hierarchies, no administration panels, no differentiated flowsâ€”everything simply revolves around the user's personal experience, who interacts with an agent capable of understanding them, remembering them, and guiding them in their professional development process.

Our project relies on three fundamental and defined layers, each with its own responsibility within the MVP's complete flow.

### Frontend (Astro + Vue + TypeScript)

This layer represents the system's voice and face, where its task is to make interaction with Artificial Intelligence feel natural, fluid, and emotionally coherent. Astro handles the platform's structure and performance, while Vue is used for interactive components: chat, diagnostic forms, and progress dashboard, and TypeScript becomes the interface's cognitive core, managing all artificial intelligence logic.

Within the frontend lives the IA Layer, a module responsible for:
- Connecting with language models (LLM)
- Coordinating agent-to-agent (A2A) communications
- Maintaining and updating conversational context through Model Context Protocol (MCP)

This converts the frontend into something more than just a simple interface; we're talking about a living environment, where AI processes user intentions, interprets their progress, and generates responses in real time before sending them to the backend for storage and analysis.

### Backend (Laravel API)

It's the system's logical and structured brain, where authentication, development paths, and conversation histories are managed. Its role is not to think, but to remember with order and purpose. Every message or significant action that arises from the client passes through Laravel, which validates, records, and preserves key information, but without participating in AI reasoning.

This way, it functions as the system's persistent memory: the guardian of historical context, while the AI handles dynamic interpretation and accompaniment.

### TCL AI (TypeScript-AI Cognitive Layer)

This component or layer lives and is born entirely in TypeScript; it's the system's intelligent engine. Through specialized modules, it coordinates three essential functions:

1. **LLM (Language Model Interface):** generates responses and analyzes user intentions
2. **A2A (Agent-to-Agent):** allows different internal subagents (subllms) to collaborate with each other to offer more precise responses and separate responsibilities
3. **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** maintains structured memory of what the system knows about the user, their progress, and their context

This module doesn't live within the backend, but alongside the frontend, allowing agile, asynchronous responses with context. The backend intervenes when recorded information is needed to generate new roadmaps and more appropriate responses for each user according to their history.

### Required Tools (AI)

- Stitch Gemini
- Claude
- ChatGPT OpenAI
- GitHub Copilot
- v0
- Groq
- Figma Make
- OpenRouter
- Warp.dev
- NotebookLLM
- Lovable
- Google AI Studio
- Sora
- NanoBanana
- Mostly.ai
- n8n

### Architectural Result

The system functions as a collaborative organism:

- **Frontend (Astro + Vue + TS)** speaks and reasons
- **Backend (Laravel + MySQL)** remembers and structures
- **TCL AI (TS + LLM + A2A + MCP)** interprets and evolves

Each maintains its respective autonomy, without disregarding the work of others, collaborating synchronously.

## Input/Output Flows (Layer Exchange)

### Frontend â†’ TCL AI

When the user interacts with the agent or completes exams to diagnose them.

```json
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "message": "I think I want to improve my English level before diving into Python.",
  "context": {
    "mode": "chat",
    "intent": "career_guidance"
  }
}
```

What we do with this is understand what the user is trying to ask, and this is achieved through a collection of intentions. If there's a match, then the LLM understands that the intention is actually an action, so it generates a result to what the user asks for. But in certain cases, it can generate useful roadmaps for them to work on improving and learning new things they're interested in.

### TCL AI â†’ Backend

If the user requires it and the LLM understands it has that stored information, then it retrieves that saved data that may be useful to the user and returns it in JSON format, i.e., raw.

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "profile_data": { "role": "data_analyst", "experience": 3 },
    "progress_state": {
      "skill_level": "intermediate",
      "english_level": "basic"
    }
  },
  "message": "I think I want to improve my English level before diving into Python.",
  "conversation_history": [
    { "sender": "user", "content": "..." },
    { "sender": "assistant", "content": "..." }
  ]
}
```

### Backend â†’ TCL AI

The data is returned again to the LLM so it can format that data, clean it, and structure it in a way the user can understand in their natural language.

### TCL AI â†’ Frontend

And finally, once this data is clean, with a good structure that can be read or understood, it's returned to the user visually and much more intuitively.

## Summary

The platform operates under a key principle: all AI interaction occurs in the frontend, while the backend only saves, queries, and returns structured data.

This ensures fluidity, low coupling, and agile response times.

### 1. Interaction Layer (User â†” AI)

The user communicates directly with the AI through the frontend, where the intelligence modules (LLM, A2A, and MCP) process inputs, interpret context, and generate personalized responses. If the AI requires previous information (like evaluations or roadmaps), it queries the backend API.

The result is displayed immediately in the interface and can update the user's local context.

- **Input:** messages, diagnoses, user actions
- **Output:** conversational responses, recommendations, or progress updates

### 2. Persistence Layer (Frontend â†” Backend)

The frontend sends to the backend only relevant data: interactions, results, progress, or new recommendations. Laravel validates, stores, and maintains record consistency.

At necessary moments, the frontend retrieves stored information from the backend to reconstruct user context or display statistics.

- **Input:** data generated by AI or user
- **Output:** persisted records and clean JSON structures for frontend consumption

### 3. Reasoning Layer (Internal AI)

The AI modules within the frontend handle all cognitive logic:
- **LLM** manages language and tone
- **A2A** coordinates specialized subagents
- **MCP** organizes memory and context

These components decide what to save, when to query the backend, and how to adapt responses according to user progress.

## Mockup Design

The ideal user experience will be fluid, personalized, and motivating. From the moment they enter the platform, the user finds an intuitive environment that invites them to discover their professional starting point through a brief and understandable evaluation.

Once they obtain their diagnosis, the system automatically generates a learning path adapted to their level and objectives, presented as a visual journey with clear and achievable milestones.

The user will be able to interact with an intelligent conversational agent that acts as their personal guide. Initially, the agent adopts a close and explanatory tone, helping them understand the results and prioritize their next steps. As the user progresses, the agent changes its role: it becomes more challenging, proposes new objectives, offers study recommendations, suggests productive habits, and celebrates achieved milestones.

This constant interaction makes the experience not feel like using a tool, but like conversing with a mentor who understands their professional evolution and accompanies them at each stage of their growth.
